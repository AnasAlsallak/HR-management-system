1. For the **Home** HTML Page
    - I modified on the JS code to save all the employees in the Local Storage so when I refresh the page I will not lose my old data.

2. For the **Accounting** HTML Page
    - I created a new JS file called accounting.js to use it in this page.
    - Render each department information in a table in the following form:
        - Department Name.
        - Number of employees in each department.
        - Average salary of the department.
        - Total salary Where average salary is the summation of salaries for all employees in each department divided by the number of the employees in that department and total salary is the summation of salaries for all employees in each department.
        - Added a table footer which will have the total number of employees, the average salary for all departments and the total salary for all departments.
