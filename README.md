1. At the **Home** HTML page
I added a form with the following fields:

    - Full name.
    - Department with following options:
        - Administration
        - Marketing
        - Development
        - Finance
    - Level with following options:
        - Junior
        - Mid-Senior
        - Senior
        - Image URL
        - Submit button

2. At the JS code 
    - I created a function to generate a unique four digits employee ID number.
    - I added an event listener to get the data from the form instead of having a hard coded data.

    - I refactored the render prototype function to render each employee information in a separate card in the home page as shown below.



3. At the CSS Style 
Add some style for the header and the footer
Use flex to organize the content of the main content.
Add backgrounds, font colors, google fonts and any additional style.
Use a suitable color palette for your website. You can use ColorHunt .
Note: Be creative and make your page professional.

Stretch goal
Separate the employees cards by their department where you will have a separate section for each department.
